IMPORTANT:
2. Fix permissions for get_all_userids
3. delete_profile sp is not in the repo

MODERATE:
2. Add a constraint limiting the number of tags a position can have
    (probably something like 10)
7. Create position button on company page
8. No such position exists error handling for update and delete position

PROBABLY DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT:
1. In the admin page the insert profile thing doesn't always insert all of them.



Create Position page has errors
    Throws an exception on insert
    doesnt do any validation
        - Salary!

Profile page has errors
    Can't update or delete
