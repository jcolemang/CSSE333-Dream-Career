IMPORTANT:
1. It would probably make sense to make a relation for tag.
    As it is we are storing the same tag many times for every
    time a position references it.
2. Fix permissions for get_all_userids
3. Fix the errors on the CreateUser page. As it is
    the Javascript errors and the C# errors sort of
    overlap.

MODERATE:
1. Add a constrain to 'Like' so a user cannot like their own profile
2. Add a constraint limiting the number of tags a position can have
    (probably something like 10)
3. Fix Dream Career logo so it doesn't overlap with the buttons
4. Make passwords secure
5. Make emails unique
6. Move the connection string to a config file

PROBABLY DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT:
1. In the admin page the insert profile thing doesn't always insert all of them.
