IMPORTANT:
2. Fix permissions for get_all_userids

MODERATE:
2. Add a constraint limiting the number of tags a position can have
    (probably something like 10)
3. Fix Dream Career logo so it doesn't overlap with the buttons
4. Make passwords secure
6. Move the connection string to a config file
7. Make a default Profile page (Default to their own?)
8. Add a salt and encryption to password storage

PROBABLY DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT:
1. In the admin page the insert profile thing doesn't always insert all of them.


profile - Joyce
search - Coleman
position - Aaradhana
Secure username and password
