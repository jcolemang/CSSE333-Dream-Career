IMPORTANT:
2. Fix permissions for get_all_userids

MODERATE:
2. Add a constraint limiting the number of tags a position can have
    (probably something like 10)
6. Move the connection string to a config file
7. Create position button on company page

1. In the admin page the insert profile thing doesn't always insert all of them.


User Profile, company, and position can be created, edited, and deleted

Aaradhana: Position
Coleman: Company
Joyce: Profile
