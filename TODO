IMPORTANT:
1. It would probably make sense to make a relation for tag.
    As it is we are storing the same tag many times for every
    time a position references it.

MODERATE:
1. Add a constrain to 'Like' so a user cannot like their own profile
2. Add a constraint limiting the number of tags a position can have
    (probably something like 10)

PROBABLY DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT:
1. Apparently the parameter adding I am doing with C#'s SqlCommand class
    is deprecated. Look in to the differences and probably switch over
